    <h1>what is w3c ?</h1>
    <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community that works together for the long-term growth of the Web.
        <br><br>
        <h3>The W3C was founded in 1994 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee at MIT. He first wrote a proposal in 1989 for a system called the World Wide Web, which would be a novel way of sharing information on computers across different locations. The W3C first brought together various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web.</h3>
